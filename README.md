# Personal Portfolio

This is my portfolio website, with its main notable features being a markdown blog and a gallery, which gets its data from a PostgreSQL database.

## Instructions

In a `.env` file in the root directory, include the following variables:

`DATABASE_URL="{Postgres connection string}"`

Run the development server using npm (or another package manager of your choice):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
